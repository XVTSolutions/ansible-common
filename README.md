Description
===========

This is a common ansible related files that can be used in across projects to
maintain custom modules/plugins etc.

To use it in the root folder of the ansible stack run

`git submodule add git@github.com:XVTSolutions/ansible-common.git`

and then update the ansible.cfg to use them.

The template repo would have the correct ansible.cfg by default to use it.
